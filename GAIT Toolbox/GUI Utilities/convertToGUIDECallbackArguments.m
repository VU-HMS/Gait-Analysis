function [hObject, eventdata, handles] = convertToGUIDECallbackArguments(app, event)
    %CONVERTTOGUIDECALLBACKARGUMENTS Converts App Designer callback
    %arguments to GUIDE-style callback arguments.
    %   [HOBJECT, EVENTDATA, HANDLES] = CONVERTTOGUIDECALLBACKARGUMENTS(APP, EVENT)
    %   is automatically added to the beginning of each migrated app
    %   callback by the GUIDE to App Designer Migration Tool to enable
    %   GUIDE-style callback code to be functional in an App Designer
    %   callback. It creates GUIDE-style callback arguments HOBJECT,
    %   EVENTDATA, and HANDLES from App Designer callback arguments APP and
    %   EVENT.
    %
    %   HOBJECT is the handle of the object whose callback is executing.
    %   For components that were of type uicontrol before being migrated to
    %   App Designer, HOBJECT will be a uicontrol-like object that has the
    %   same properties as a uicontrol to enable most uicontrol-style code
    %   to function in an App Designer callback.
    %
    %   EVENTDATA is usually empty but can be a structure containing
    %   specific information about the callback event.
    %
    %   HANDLES is a structure containing all the child components of the
    %   app's figure that have a value defined for their Tag property.
    %   Child components of the figure that were of type uicontrol before
    %   being migrated to App Designer, will be a uicontrol-like object
    %   that has the same properties as a uicontrol to enable most
    %   uicontrol-style code to function in an App Designer callback.
